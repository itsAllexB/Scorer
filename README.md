# Scorer
Hello and welcome to the second project that I had to do for Google Android Basics Challange.

For the people who are new to github, if you want to access or see:
    - activity_main.xml, go to: Scorer/app/src/main/res/layout/
    - MainActivity.java, go to: Scorer/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/scorer/
    - drawable folder, go to: Scorer/app/src/main/res/
